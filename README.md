# React Visual Sorting Project

This project was inspired by Cl√©ment Mihailescu's Sorting Visualizer project. I sought out to recreate the project after beginning the React portion of my coding bootcamp. The application utilizes React hooks and Promises to visually show the process behind a sorting algorithm. The three sorting algorithms currently available are Insertion, Selection, and Bubble sort. Enjoy!
